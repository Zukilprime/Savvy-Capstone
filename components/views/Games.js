  The first roleplaying game to make mainstream popularity. Currently in its fifth edition, Dungeons and Dragons is one of the largest game systems today. The system is primarily a fantasy based and has a player create a character to inhabit the game world. A game master is required to run the game and create exciting situations for the players to navigate. You can play as your favorite fantasy race and swing a sword or sling spells to defeat the enemies before you!

<p>
Pathfinder is the offshoot of an earlier edition (third edition to be precise) of Dungeons and Dragons. It was designed by Paizo to create their own system to give players dissatisfied with the upcoming fourth edition of Dungeons and Dragons and improved system that was similar to the outgoing edition of Dungeons and Dragons. It is now in its second edition and doing well. Pathfinder has made itself distinct from its originating game.

Warhammer fantasy is one of the older table top war games. You build an army of units to wage war on the opponent. Filled with colorful history and exciting races, no game plays out the same. Swarm the enemy with hordes of Orcs, or skillfully eradicate the opponent with the stoic Dwarves. There are many races to choose from and you are sure to find a favorite.
