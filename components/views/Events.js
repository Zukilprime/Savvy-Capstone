<p>
Brave Moose is holding its annual running event this Saturday! Come join the crew with a wintery run through the beautiful countryside. Warm up afterwards with a hot cider or maybe something with a bit more kick.
</p>
<p>
We have a selection of goodies to enjoy around the campfire. S'mores, marshmallows, hot dogs, and more! We have a wide selection of treats to add to our famous hot cocoa.
</p>
<p>
Remember, it's going to be cold out. Please layer appropriately. Brave Moose wants you to have a good time and enjoy your time with our staff and fellow runners. So, please run responsibly and we'll see you at the finish line!
