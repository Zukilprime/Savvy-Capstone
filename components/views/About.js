  After leaving Canada for warmer pastures, Bullwinkle decided to settle down and bring his love of gaming to the population in our fine town. He found that he loved the apples left in our orchards and would be seen frolicking through the street after a night out. Bullwinkle decided to lay down roots here after one such night. He didn't have many skills to market, but he had a love of games and wanted to share that love with our townsfolk. And so, Brave Moose Gaming was born!

Thidwick is one of our esteemed residents with a long family history around town. Known for running one of the best bed and breakfast inns in the state. The scones are really impressive by the way. Thidwick was tired of the service industry life and didn't want to continue the family business. So, after a chance meeting with Bullwinkle, he decided to help run the new store we know and love. Thidwick brought his hospitality skills to the store and made some solid improvements all around.

They are diligent in their attention to your needs and will go the extra mile to get you that special gift you are looking for, wherever it may go. Most of them migrated from the north to get out of the cold winters and we are overjoyed to have them.
