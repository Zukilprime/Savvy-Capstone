This is the start of my project.

<h3>Audience</h3> 
The primary audience will be owners of small gaming stores and comic shops.

<h3>Statement</h3>
I'm designing this project to be an all-in-one website for a small game store to use and hopefully broaden their appeal. The 
webpage will create a robust site that can serve all of the store's needs without using multiple websites to host the store, social gatherings, and events. This should also save the store money by reducing hosting costs.

<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3> 
I want to broaden and enhance small business owners websites to drive sales and engagement with their brand. Why pay for a site 
to host your online goods and another to host your social gatherings? Players are going to want to have an easy to use site that 
lets them do everything they need in one place. Keep it local to really focus on the people that matter. Your customers that 
come into the store! 

<h3>Content Outline</h3> 
<p>Customers will land on the Home page and get a snapshot of the events and games going on in the store. From the Home page, 
The Navigation bar will have links or a dropdown to the other pages on the website. The Visio PDF has the desired full 
experience.</p>

<p>From the Home page, users can access the Games, Events, Social, Store, and About pages.</p>

<p>The Games page will have sub-catagories to video game console time rentals, information on table-top roleplaying games, and 
table-top board games. It will also have links to reserving rooms or table space time from the social page. It will also have a 
full list of available games for use in the store.</p>

The Social page will have a place to search for players for the various games from an opt-in database. Players can enter in 
their information and what games or activities they are interested in joining. It will also have space to request room or table 
space timeblocks. It will also have a space to link to a dedicated message board for game store related posts.

The Events page will list all of the current deals and upcoming events to the store. It will also list all of the stores social 
media links.

The Store page will have all of the stores merchandise that can be ordered online. Can be used for call ahead orders or 
shipping.

The About page has all of the information about the store. This includes location and directions. It will also list the owner 
and the managers of the store with photos. It will also list any positions that might be open at the store.

<h3>User Flow</h3>  
The Navigation bar drives the user through the site. Each page is accessible from the bar and each page has additional 
information that I would like to add in to allow deeper customization of the selected information or search.
